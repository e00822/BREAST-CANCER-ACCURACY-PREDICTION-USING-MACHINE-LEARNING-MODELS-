Study pupose:

  This study highlights the significant potential of machine learning models in breast cancer prediction when incorporating both Breast Cancer Gene Expression Profiles and clinical features. The future development of ensemble models for breast cancer prediction holds tremendous potential in revolutionizing the field of medical diagnostics and treatment. By integrating cutting-edge machine learning techniques, multi-modal data, and ethical considerations, these models can make a significant impact on patient outcomes, contributing to earlier detection, personalized treatment plans, and improved survival rates for breast cancer patients. These models can greatly improve patient care by utilizing effective deep-learning architectures, boosting interpretability, enabling real-time predictions, and overcoming difficulties with data. The complete potential of ensemble models in the battle against breast cancer will be realized through persistent collaboration between machine learning experts, medical researchers, and healthcare providers.
